## An aMAZEing Minetest game

## VERSION 0.5

This is very much a work in progress, technically quite playable though. 

Just escape the maze to "win" and you'll be greeted with a new one to complete!

Hint: play "cave" on <50 render distances, not that you need more.


### Todo

1.. Implement at least 5 default styles with their own music, 4 of 5 done. Rap remaining only.
