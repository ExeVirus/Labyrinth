    Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material

Under the following terms:

    Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.

Remember, Youtube only allows CC-BY, and cannot fully allow CC-BY-SA distribution, so please just ask for permission before using the music in a youtube video.
Obviously putting music on streaming services is also a no-go since they restrict the usage more than CC-BY-SA. You get the idea. Make sure it stays sharable :)
